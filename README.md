experimentChangePointDetectionForDiscreteSeries
===============================================

Some exeriments with formulas for discrete series change point detection. Neither nice nor optimized. 
The sample application so far tries to identify the switch between a die and a loaded one (one side with doubled probability).
The initial focus of this project was to play with different modifications of a pure maximum likelihood formulas.
